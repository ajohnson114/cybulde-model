# Cyberbullying detection project

Hi! Thanks for taking a look at my project! I just finished making it, and will have a more detailed write up here in the upcoming days. This is just the section with the model training and creation of gcp instance groups for distributed and parallelized training if you'd like to see the other repos just let me know and I can make those public.

As a brief summary, the project is an end to end cyber bullying detection machine learning project that uses GCP for a lot of things (PostgresSQL backend, VMs to prepare the data, VMs to train the model) and I'm looking to create a web app in the future but the model needs to be trained (it was slowed due to slow training locally and VM's not installing NVIDIA drivers well). If you're looking at this repo and can think of a work around for zone resouce issues or nvidia drivers not installing suggestions would be appreciated.

This took me a lot of time and is more sophisticated than I can explain in a sentence but stay tuned! Thanks!
