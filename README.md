# Cyberbullying detection project

As a brief summary, the project is an end to end cyber bullying detection machine learning project that uses GCP for a lot of things (PostgresSQL backend, VMs to prepare the data, VMs to train the model). It was an interesting experience for me to build and I think I learned a lot about software engineering and machine learning engineering as well.

I made this a long time ago and forgot some of the context about it truthfully but can look into any questions I may get about it. Thanks for checking it out!

This is a systems design diagram of how the distributed model training happened:
